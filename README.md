## Movie Recommendation App Backend: README File
1. Create/Update README.md: Create a README.md file in your project root (prodev_bemovie_backend/README.md) and include:
Project Title & Description: ProDev BEMovie Recommendation Backend
Overview: Briefly describe the project.
Project Goals: List the primary objectives.
Technologies Used: Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, Swagger, TMDb API.
Key Features: Detail the API for movie recommendations, user management, performance optimization, and comprehensive documentation.
Setup Instructions:
Prerequisites (Python, PostgreSQL, Redis)
Cloning the repository
Setting up the virtual environment
Installing dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt)
Database setup (PostgreSQL, settings.py config, migrations)
TMDb API key setup (.env file)
Running the development server
API Endpoints:
Authentication:
POST /api/auth/register/ (User registration)
POST /api/token/ (Obtain JWT access and refresh tokens)
POST /api/token/refresh/ (Refresh access token)
POST /api/token/verify/ (Verify access token - optional)
Movies:
GET /api/movies/trending/ (Get trending movies)
GET /api/movies/{movie_id}/ (Get movie details by ID)
GET /api/movies/{movie_id}/recommendations/ (Get recommendations for a movie)
User Favorites (Authentication Required):
GET /api/favorites/ (List user's favorite movies)
POST /api/favorites/ (Add a movie to favorites)
DELETE /api/favorites/{favorite_movie_id}/ (Remove a movie from favorites)
Swagger Documentation: Mention that the interactive API documentation is available at /api/docs/ after running the server.
Development & Testing Notes: Any specific instructions for developers.
Deployment Notes: (Optional, if you have specific deployment instructions)
Evaluation Criteria: Reiterate the functionality, code quality, performance, and documentation criteria.



Generate requirements.txt:
Bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt


Git Commit:
Bash
git add .
git commit -m "docs: update README with API details"


Phase 5: Testing and Deployment
Run Development Server:
Bash
python manage.py runserver


Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/docs/ to see your Swagger UI documentation.
Test all endpoints using tools like Postman, Insomnia, or the Swagger UI itself.
Deployment (e.g., Heroku, Render, AWS, DigitalOcean): This is a broader topic, but generally involves:
Containerization (Docker): Recommended for consistent environments.
Gunicorn/uWSGI: For serving Django applications in production.
Nginx/Apache: As a reverse proxy for Gunicorn/uWSGI and serving static files.
Environment Variables: Properly configure DEBUG=False, ALLOWED_HOSTS, database credentials, API keys, etc., using environment variables in your deployment environment.
Static Files: Collect static files (python manage.py collectstatic) and configure your web server to serve them.
Database Migrations: Run migrations on the production server.
Redis Deployment: Set up a Redis instance on your hosting provider.
Example Heroku (simplified):
Install Heroku CLI.
heroku login
heroku create your-app-name
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
heroku addons:create heroku-redis:hobby-dev
Configure settings.py to use dj-database-url and django-heroku for production database/static file settings.
Create Procfile: web: gunicorn movie_recommendation_project.wsgi
git push heroku master
heroku run python manage.py migrate
heroku run python manage.py createsuperuser
Set TMDB_API_KEY in Heroku config vars.
Evaluation Criteria Checklist:
Functionality:
[ ] APIs retrieve movie data accurately (/api/movies/trending/, /api/movies/{id}/, /api/movies/{id}/recommendations/)
[ ] User registration (/api/auth/register/) works.
[ ] JWT token generation (/api/token/) and refresh (/api/token/refresh/) work.
[ ] Favorite movie storage (/api/favorites/) works (add, list, delete).
[ ] Error handling for API calls (TMDb service and internal APIs) is robust.
Code Quality:
[ ] Code is modular (e.g., services.py for API calls, serializers.py, models.py, views.py).
[ ] Code is maintainable (clear naming, logical separation).
[ ] Code is well-commented.
[ ] Implements Python best practices (PEP 8).
[ ] Uses Django ORM effectively for database interactions.
Performance:
[ ] Caching with Redis for movie data (trending_movies, movie_detail, movie_recommendations) is implemented.
[ ] API response times are improved by caching (you can test this by making repeated requests).
[ ] Database queries for user favorites are optimized (Django ORM handles this well for basic cases; for complex queries, consider select_related, prefetch_related).
Documentation:
[ ] Swagger documentation is detailed and accessible at /api/docs/.
[ ] All API endpoints are documented in Swagger.
[ ] README.md includes clear setup instructions and API details.
